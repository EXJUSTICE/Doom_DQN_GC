# Automating Doom with Deep Q-Learning: An Implementation in Tensorflow.

In this article, we’ll explore how Q-learning can be applied to training an agent to play the classic FPS game Doom, through the use of the open-source OpenAI gym wrapper library Vizdoomgym. We’ll guide you through setting up your first agent, and lay the foundations of future work.
